A _semigroup_ is any [[set]] that has **at least one** [[associative]] [[binary operation]] that can be performed on all of it's [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]].

For any given _semigroup_, since it is [[associative]], $a^n$ can be defined as:
$a^1 = a$
$a^2 = a * a$
$a^3 = a * a * a$
...
$a^n = a * a^{n-1}$

### Notation:
A _semigroup_ can be denoted as $(A, *)$

### Examples: Common Operations in $\mathbb R$

| Operation      | Semigroup             |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Addition       | $(\mathbb R, +)$      |
| Multiplication | $(\mathbb R, \times)$ |
