A _semigroup_ is any [[set]] that has **at least one** [[Associative]] [[Binary Operation]] that can be performed on all of it's [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]].

---
### Notation:
A _semigroup_ can be denoted as $(A, *)$

---
### Examples: Common Operations in $\mathbb R$

| [[Binary Operation]] | Semigroup             |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Addition             | $(\mathbb R, +)$      |
| Multiplication       | $(\mathbb R, \times)$ |
