A _binary operation_ is an operation performed on two [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] of [[set]] that yield another [[Object (Set Theory)|element]] of the same set.

---
### Notation:
A _binary operation_ on $x, y \in A$ is denoted as $x * y \in A$

---
### Examples: Common Operations in $\mathbb R$

| Operation      | Implication                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Addition       | $\forall x, y \in \mathbb R \implies x + y \in R$      |
| Subtraction    | $\forall x, y \in \mathbb R \implies x - y \in R$      |
| Multiplication | $\forall x, y \in \mathbb R \implies x \times y \in R$ |

**Note:** Division is _not_ included as $\forall x \in \mathbb R, \frac{x}{0} = undefined$
