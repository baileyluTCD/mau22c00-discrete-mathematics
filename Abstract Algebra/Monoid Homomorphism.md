A _[[Monoid]] [[Homomorphism]]_ is a special case of a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] where in addition to [[Semigroup|semigroup]] structure being preserved, the [[Identity Element|identity element]] must also be preserved.

> The primary difference between a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] and a _[[Monoid]] [[Homomorphism]]_ is that:
> - [[Homomorphism]]: [[Function]] from [[Semigroup|semigroup]] to [[Semigroup|semigroup]].
> - _[[Monoid]] [[Homomorphism]]_: [[Function]] from [[Monoid|monoid]] to [[Monoid|monoid]].
