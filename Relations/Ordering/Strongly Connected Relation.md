A _strongly [[Connected Relation]]_ on $A$ is a [[relation]] that relates all elements in a given [[set]] in one direction or another.

$$\forall x,y \in A, (x, y) \in A \lor (y, x) \in A$$

> [!note]
> The primary difference between a [[Connected Relation|connected relation]] and a _strongly [[Connected Relation]]_ is that a _strongly [[Connected Relation]]_ also provides an ordering for **elements that are equal**.
