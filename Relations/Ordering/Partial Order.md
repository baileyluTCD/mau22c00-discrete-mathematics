An _partial order_ on $A$ is a [[relation]] that is 
1. [[Reflexive Relation|Reflexive]]
2. [[Anti-Symmetric Relation|Anti-Symmetric]]
3. [[Transitive Relation|Transitive]]

A _partial order_ is similar to an [[Equivalence Relation]] but based on an [[Anti-Symmetric Relation]] instead of a [[Symmetric Relation]].

### Example:
The [PartialEq](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html) **trait** is an **example** of a _partial ordering_.

---
### Notation
If $x$ is a **partial order** to $y$ we write $x \preceq y$
