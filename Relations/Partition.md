The _partition_ of a [[set]] is a **grouping** of [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] into [[Subset|subsets]] so that each [[Object (Set Theory)|element]] is included in **exactly one** [[subset]].

Every [[subset]] in a _partition_ **must** be a non [[Empty Set|empty set]].

Any two [[Set|sets]] in a _partition_ are [[Disjoint set|disjoint]] such that their [[union]], is $A$, the original set.

### Example:
$A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ 

**Partitions of $A$: **
- $\{ \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\} \}$
- $\{ \{1\}, \{2, 3\} \}$
- $\{ \{1, 2\}, \{3\} \}$
- $\{ \{1\}, \{3\}, \{2\} \}$
- $\{ \{1, 2, 3\} \}$
