A _reflexive [[relation]]_ on $A$ is a [[relation]] that relates every [[Object (Set Theory)|element]] of $A$ to itself.

$$\forall x \in A, x Rx$$

> A _reflexive [[relation]]_ can be though of as if an item can be compared with itself, similar to the [Hash Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html).
