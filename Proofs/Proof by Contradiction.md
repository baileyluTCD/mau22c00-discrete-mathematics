Proof by contradiction proves a statement to be true by showing that assuming the statement is false creates a contradiction.

**Example: Prove $\sqrt2$ is irrational**

1. Assume the _opposite is true_ (i.e. $\sqrt2$ can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$).
		$\sqrt2 = \frac{a}{b}$
		$2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$	
		$2b^2 = a^2$
2. Notice $a^2$ can be _divided_ by $2$ as above $\therefore$ $a = 2k$.
		$2b^2 = (2k)^2$
		$2b^2 = 4k^2$
		$b^2 = 2k^2$
3. Both $a$ and $b$ _must be even then_ in this case, hence they have a common divisor.
4. If a common divisor exists here $\sqrt2$ _cannot be_ written as $\frac{a}{b}$.
5. Hence, it must be irrational _proved by contradiction_.
