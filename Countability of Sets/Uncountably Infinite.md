An _uncountably infinite_ [[set]] is a [[set]] that is neither [[Finite]] or [[Countably Infinite|countable]].

> [!example]
> The [[power set]] of $\mathbb N$ is _uncountably infinite_ as it has provably larger **cardinality** than the [[natural numbers]] ($2^n$), hence does not have a [[Injective|one to one]] mapping onto $\mathbb N$.
