An _uncountably [[infinite]]_ [[set]] is a [[set]] that is neither [[finite]] or [[Countably Infinite|countable]].

> [!example]
> The [[power set]] of $\mathbb N$ is _uncountably [[infinite]]_ as it has provably larger **cardinality** than the [[natural numbers]] ($2^n$), hence does not have a [[Injective|one to one]] mapping onto $\mathbb N$.

> [!example]
> $\mathbb R$ ([[Real Numbers]]) is _uncountably infinite_ as it can be mapped to $(0, 1)$:
> > $\tan (- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ -> $\mathbb R$ is a [[Bijective|bijection]].
> 
> As this repeats $\mathbb N$ times for each range between natural numbers, the set $\mathbb R$ must have a larger **cardinality** than the [[natural numbers]]
