A [[set]] is _countably [[Infinite]]_ if it is [[Infinite]] and can be made into a [[injective]] mapping to the [[natural numbers]]. 

$$A \textasciitilde \mathbb N^* $$
> [!note] 
> Every [[Subsequence]] in a _countably [[infinite]] [[set]]_ must also be countably [[infinite]].

> [!example]
> Examples of _countably [[infinite]] [[set|sets]]_ are:
> - $\mathbb N$ -> The natural numbers
> - $\mathbb Q$ -> The rational numbers
> - All even integers above $0$
