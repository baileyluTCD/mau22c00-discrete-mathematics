The _implies_ [[Connective|connective]].

**Truth table for $\implies$:

| $P$     | $Q$     | $P \implies Q$ |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| `true`  | `true`  | `true`         |
| `true`  | `false` | `false`        |
| `false` | `true`  | `true`         |
| `false` | `false` | `true`         |

The only case in which an implication will be false is when the original hypothesis containing $P$ is true but the conclusion about $Q$ is false
