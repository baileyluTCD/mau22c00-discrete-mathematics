Tautologies are [[Proposition|propositions]] built from [[Connective|connectives]] that are always `true`.

---

Some common tautologies are:

1. $(P \implies Q) \iff (\lnot P \lor Q)$
2. $(P \iff Q) \iff ([P \implies Q] \land [Q \implies P])$
3. $\lnot(P \land Q) \iff (\lnot P \lor \lnot Q)$
4. $\lnot(P \lor Q) \iff (\lnot P \land \lnot Q)$
