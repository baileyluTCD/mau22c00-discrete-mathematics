The _if and only if_ [[Connective|connective]].

---

**Truth table for $\iff$:

| $P$     | $Q$     | $P \iff Q$ |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `true`  | `true`  | `true`     |
| `true`  | `false` | `false`    |
| `false` | `true`  | `false`    |
| `false` | `false` | `true`     |

_If and only if_ can be considered to mean that $P$ and $Q$ must have the **same** "truthy" value.
