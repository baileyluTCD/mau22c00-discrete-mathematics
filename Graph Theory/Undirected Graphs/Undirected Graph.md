An _undirected [[graph]]_ is a [[graph]] consisting of:
- A [[Empty Set|Non-Empty]] [[Finite]] [[set]] of [[Vertex|vertices]] $V$
- A [[Empty Set|Non-Empty]] [[Finite]] [[set]] of [[Edge|edges]] $E$ joining any two [[Vertex|vertices]] without an associated direction in which the join takes place

The [[set]] of possible [[Edge|edges]] available for an _undirected [[graph]]_ is always the [[power set]] of the [[Vertex|vertices]] filtered to [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] of [[Cardinality]] $2$

$V = \{A, B, C\}$
$E = \{AB ,BC ,AC\}$
