The _component_ of a [[graph]] is a [[partition]] of the [[graph]] where all [[Vertex|vertices]] must be [[Connected Graph|connected]] by a [[Walk]] between them.

All [[Undirected Graph|undirected graphs]] may be viewed as a single _[[graph]] component_, hence, all [[Undirected Graph|undirected graphs]] are a [[subset]] of all _[[graph]] components_.
