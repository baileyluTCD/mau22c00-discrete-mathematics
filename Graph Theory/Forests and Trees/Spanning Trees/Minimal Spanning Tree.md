A _minimal [[spanning tree]]_ is a [[spanning tree]] where, in a [[graph]] such that every [[edge]] has a value associated with it, the _minimal [[spanning tree]]_ is the [[spanning tree]] with the lowest overall value of the combined [[edge|edges]].

> This is a _minimal [[spanning tree]]_ where the total **weight** of the [[Edge|edges]] has been minimised.
