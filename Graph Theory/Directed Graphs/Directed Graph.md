A _directed graph_ is a type of [[graph]] where every [[edge]] has an **associated direction**.

> [!example]
> ![[Directed Graph Image.png]]
> This is a _directed graph_ with $5$ [[vertex|vertices]]. Each [[vertex]] is connected by an [[edge]] with a given direction.

### Vertex Direction Types

graph LR;
	A(Initial Vertex)
	B(Terminal Vertex)
	A --> B
```
#### Initial Vertex
The _initial_ vertex_ is the vertex at the start of an [[edge]].
#### Terminal Vertex
The _terminal vertex_ is the vertex at the end of an [[edge]].
