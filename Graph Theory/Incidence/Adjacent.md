Two [[Vertex|vertices]] are considered _adjacent_ if they are **joined by** the same [[edge]].

Being _adjacent_ is a [[symmetric relation]].

### Example:

| [[Vertex]] | Adjacent [[Vertex\|vertices]] |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| $a$        | $c$, $d$                      |
| $c$        | $a$, $e$                      |
