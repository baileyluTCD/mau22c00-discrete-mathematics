An _[[Eulerian]] [[trail]]_ is a [[trail]] which traverses every [[edge]] in a [[graph]] exactly once.

### Testing if a [[graph]] has an _[[eulerian]] trail_
If a [[graph]] has either $0$ or $2$ [[Vertex|vertices]] with an odd number of [[Degree|degrees]], then it must contain an _[[eulerian]] trail_.

> If it has $0$, the [[graph]] has an [[eulerian circuit]].
> If it has $2$, the [[graph]] has a non [[closed]] _[[eulerian]] trail_.
