The _compliment_ $/$ of a [[Set|set]] within another [[Set|set]] is the [[Set|set]] of [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] that **fit within** the _first_ [[Set|set]] but not the _second_ [[Set|set]].

$A/B$ is the [[Set|set]] of [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] in $A$ that **aren't also** in $B$.

The _compliment_ of $U/A$ can be written as $A^C$ where $U$ is the [[Universal Set]].

The _universal compliment_ is an [[Involution]].

### Boolean Algebra Translation
_Compliment_ may be rewritten with [[Connective|connectives]] and [[Quantifiers|quantifiers]] in the form $A / B \rightarrow x | x \in A \land x \not\in B$
