The _subset_ operator $\subseteq$, allows us to define a _smaller_ [[set]] which consists of [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] which fit **entirely inside** or are **equal** to a _larger_ [[set]].

$B \subseteq A$ where all the elements of $B$ exist inside $A$ or $B = A$.

### Proper Subsets
A _proper subset_ $\subset$ is a _subset_ where $B$ entirely within exists in $A$ but $B \ne A$

---
### Empty Subsets
The [[Empty Set]] is a _subset_ of **all** [[set]]s.

### Boolean Algebra Translation
_Subset_ may be rewritten with [[Connective|connectives]] and [[Quantifiers|quantifiers]] in the form $A \subseteq B \rightarrow \forall x ( x \in A \implies x \in B)$
