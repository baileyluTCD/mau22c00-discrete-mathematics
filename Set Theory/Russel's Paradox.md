_Russel's Paradox_ is a paradox effecting the realm of [[Set Theory]].

It states:
- Consider a [[Set|set]] $S$ which contains another [[Set|set]] $A$
- $A$ contains an [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] which can produce any other possible [[Set|set]] in $S$.
- Is $S$ an [[Object (Set Theory)|element]] of $S$?
