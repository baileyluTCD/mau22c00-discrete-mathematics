An _inverted function_ is a [[function]] that when applied to the [[codomain]] of a [[function]] returns the original [[domain]].

### Notation:
The **inversion** of a function $f$ is denoted as $f^{-1}$.

### Properties:
In order for an inverted function $f^{-1}$ to be created $f$ must be [[bijective]].
