A [[Language|language]] is known as _[[Turing Machine|Turing]]-Recognisable_ if there exists a [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] that recognises it.

A given [[Language|language]] can either **accept**, **reject** or **loop**, hence it is not that strong of a notion of seeing if it will finish as a user will not have [[Infinite|infinite]] time. Hence, a [[Decider]] may be used.

### Non Recognisable Languages

There are a number of problems which are not [[Turing-Recognisable|turing-recognisable]] and hence cannot be algorithmically solved.

> [!note]
> The [[set]] of all [[Language|languages]] over an [[alphabet]] $A$ is [[uncountably infinite]]. However, the [[set]] of all [[Turing-Recognisable|turing-recognisable]] [[Language|languages]] is [[Countably Infinite|countably infinite]], hence there are many more [[Language|languages]] in $A$ that are valid [[Turing Machine|turing machines]].
