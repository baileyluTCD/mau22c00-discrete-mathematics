A [[Language|language]] is known as _[[Turing Machine|Turing]]-Recognisable_ if there exists a [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] that recognises it.

A given [[Language|language]] can either **accept**, **reject** or **loop**, hence it is not that strong of a notion of seeing if it will finish as a user will not have [[Infinite|infinite]] time. Hence, a [[Decider]] may be used.
