A _Universal [[Turing Machine]]_ is a [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] that can **simulate** any other [[Turing Machine|turing machine]].

This idea of placing the **actions** (functions, etc) and the **input data** (variables, etc) in the **same memory** lead to the modern idea of the Von Neumann computing model.
