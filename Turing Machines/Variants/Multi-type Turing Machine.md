A _Multi-type [[Turing Machine]]_ is a variant of the [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] with multiple [[Turing Machine#Tape|tapes]] with their own **individual heads**.

It starts on the first [[Turing Machine#Tape|tape]] and is given a new operation which allows for the movement of a head on a different [[Turing Machine#Tape|tape]] arbitrarily.

However, similar to the [[Stay Put Turing Machine]] this operation also does not provide an **increase in computational power** as the original [[Turing Machine#Tape|tape]] is [[countably infinite]] and so are the extra [[Turing Machine#Tape|tapes]], hence nothing new can happen.
