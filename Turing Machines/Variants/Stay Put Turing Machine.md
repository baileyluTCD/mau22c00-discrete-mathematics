A _Stay Put [[Turing Machine]]_ is a variant of the [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] with a new movement option instead of just `left` or `right` - `stay put`.

However, this `stay put` operation can be expressed as the combination of:
- $1$ `right` and $1$ `left`
- $1$ `left` and $1$ `right`

Hence, there is actually no difference on an [[infinite]] timescale, leading to **no increase** in **computational power**.
