An _Enumerator_ is a variant of the [[Turing Machine|turing machine]] with an attached "printer" that prints out the strings built by the [[turing machine]] as they are [[Turing-Recognisable|recognised]].

However, any string printed by the printer could have eventually turned up anyway in the [[turing machine]]'s outputs anyway, hence it **does not** provide any extra **computational power**.
