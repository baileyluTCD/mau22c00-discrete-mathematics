If $A$ is a [[finite]] [[set]], in the context of **Formal Languages**, $A$ is known as an _alphabet_. 

---
### Cardinality
If $A$ is a [[finite]] _alphabet_ then the [[set]] of all [[Word|words]] over $A$ is [[countably infinite]].

Additionally, the following are `true`:
- The [[set]] of [[Regular Language|regular languages]] is [[countably infinite]].
- The [[set]] of [[Language|languages]] is [[uncountably infinite]].

Hence [[Regular Language|regular languages]] are a special category of [[language|languages]] over a given _alphabet_.

### Examples:
#### Example: Binary Digits
$A = \{0, 1\}$
#### Example: Decimal Digits
$A = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \}$
#### Example: English 
$A = English$
$A \cap \{A, B, C\} = \{A, B, C\}$
