A _normal [[Regular Grammar]]_ is a [[Regular Grammar]] when it is in [[Regular Grammar#Form|form]] $1.$ or $3.$

Any [[language]] generated by a [[Regular Grammar]] can be **also** generated by a [[Regular Grammar]] in _normal form_ because production rules in form $2.$ can be created from the other two rules.
