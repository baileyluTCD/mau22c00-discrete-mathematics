A _non-terminal_ is a **string** which does not consist entirely of [[letters]] which exist in a given [[alphabet]].

Other [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] which may exist in a _non-terminal_ include [[Grammar#Example|Start Symbols]].

A _non-terminal_ is a similar concept to [String Interpolation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html) where the **variables** would be the _non-terminals_.
