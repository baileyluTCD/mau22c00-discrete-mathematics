A _phase structure [[Grammar]]_ is similar to a [[Context-Sensitive Grammar]], but the **production rules** may contain **more than one** [[Non-Terminals|non-terminal]], and are required to contain **at least one** [[Non-Terminals|non-terminal]].

The following **production rule** is valid in a _phase structure [[Grammar]]_, but not in a [[Context-Sensitive Grammar]]:
$$0<s>1<s>0 \rightarrow 00010$$
