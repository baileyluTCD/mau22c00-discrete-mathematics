A _regular expression_ is a single [[word]] contained in a [[Regular Language]].

If $A$ is an [[alphabet]]:
1. $\emptyset$ (the [[empty set]] of [[word|words]]), $\epsilon$ (the [[empty word]]) and all other [[Object (Set Theory)|elements]] of $A$ are _regular expressions_.
2. If $w$ and $w'$ are _regular expressions_, then $w \circ w'$ and $w*$ are _regular expressions_
